# The ~~summer~~ winter was ours for the making. Now its over.

I joined Hack Club for SoM through an invite through a Discord server. After a few minor setbacks (RIP 2020 M1 Macbook Pro) I was off to the races in VScode, making (rather poorly developed) websites! For me (and many others) it was in the winter, but potato potato.

You can see my [SoM Wrapped](https://summer.hackclub.com/wrapped/share/sDn8Ues) there.
