On Monday at 10am EST, the Hack Club Slack went down for the long-awaited migration to Slack’s Enterprise Grid.

In theory, this unlocks all the fun enterprise-tier features: SAML SSO via Hack Club Account (IDV), a unified identity layer, and Workflow Builder Branching (which was very short-lived — RIP Workflows).

**The keyword being “in theory.”**

As soon as things came back up, everything was a little off.

Problem #1: Email mismatch
My Slack account uses a different email than my Hack Club Account (IDV). Because Enterprise Grid treats your SSO as the primary email, Slack logged me into a completely different account that wasn’t mine, _but still an account on an email I owned._

Problem #2: This might break my ability to submit to YSWS Programs
Since my emails are split — one on the slitrostudio.me domain, the other being my old Gmail — I have no idea how this affects things like submitting The House Standard Deviation to Flavortown. If Hack Club Accounts are now the source of truth and I can’t change that email, that’s… not great.

I’ve managed to get back into my normal Slack account, but everything else (like YSWS programs) is blocked because I can’t re-verify my identity. I don’t exactly want to risk getting flagged for fraud just to submit again. And right now, IDV simply doesn’t support changing your email.

HQ’s current answer is basically: “wait until IDV supports email changes.”

For a migration that’s supposed to unify identity, it’s a strange place to be stuck.

Thanks for listening to me yap.
