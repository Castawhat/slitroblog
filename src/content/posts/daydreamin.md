# What do making a game, getting locked in a box, and drinking lots of L&P have in common?
## That's right, Daydream!

Daydream was a fun event held over the weekend of the 27th-28th in more than 100 cities!

Before attending, I had no experience with Godot. By the end, I actually knew how to make a game in Godot!  
About the "getting locked in a box"â€”I ended up stuck in a conferencing pod and was told to "make a scene" while my partner played Clash.

The theme was "a sacrifice must be made," so we created a game where jumping required pressing space 12 times, sacrificing your fingers for the cause.
We called it Carpal Tunnel Simulator.
You can play the game [Here!](https://castawhat.itch.io/sacplatform)
